# gitpub_pipeline_modified
I have made some alterations to the original GitHub pipeline. Now, you can load stargazers through the stargazers resource in the github_reaction source. Additionally, you can view more information about pull requests, such as reviews, comments on reviews, and reactions on comments on reviews. You can also see the head and base repositories of PR.
